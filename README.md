# Postgram

Something like an Instagram clone but not really. Quite limited functionality at the moment. Somewhat responsive design.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. To run this app you also need the server located on the repository softuni-backend. To run the server open terminal in the server folder and write `npm run start`. The server will start on port 3000. Additional configurations are needed. In the config folder of the server you need to fill the dbUrl field with your local database or Atlas mongo database.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
